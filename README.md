# Data-Cleaning
The project highlights key steps for transforming raw(dirty) data into usable(clean) data.

**Data Cleaning** is a stage in the data preparation process that involves fixing errors, identifying inconsistencies, and generally improving the quality and reliability of data before it can be used for analysis. This process is carried out early in the analytics cycle before building advanced Machine Learning models or generating insights. If done properly, Data Cleaning improves the accuracy of decisions without compromising vital data, thereby avoiding Garbage in Garbage out (GIGO) situation.

Manually cleaning data is a tedious process. However, the Python Pandas library has a range of techniques (methods) that help transform raw data to usable form in an efficient manner. These techniques have been applied in this project to convert the **dirty_data** dataframe to **clean_data**. 

In order to create a comprehensive data cleaning project, data used for this project was created from a combination of online datasets with each column edited to address common data cleaning issues like; Missing Columns, Duplicate Values, Changing Datatypes, Cleaning Strings, etc.
